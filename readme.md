# Reels
Reels is a app that enables car sellers to take video clips of their car to make nice video ads. Formerly Foliown. I need to change the naming.

## ffmpeg
Using ffmpeg to stitch together video clips and overlay text descriptions of the vehicle for sale

## Vehicle data
Using government services to get vehicle data - no API provided so parsing html output required.
